# Project Proposal:

# The 5 Ws and W NOTS

Reflect on everything you can dream that your application could do. On your first pass through, add everything to the "am doing" sections - the who, what, where, when, and why.

Reflect on the target audience of your project proposal, then begin shifting items from "am doing" to their corresponding NOT section.

Reorganize as you see fit. Tables or different markdown organization, but the sections should be easily identifiable.
