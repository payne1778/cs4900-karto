## Branding Guide

#### Colors

The two primary colors are chosen to be somewhat dull and old to match that vintage car feeling for the entire app, with the accent being slight variations of these main colors. The neutral blacks and grays also follow the same 2 main colors with alterations towards the black.

#### Buttons

There will be three types of buttons, which the first two are regular buttons that users are used to with a Filled and Outline variations that has their different uses throughout the applications.

The other style is an icon button, where the main content of the buttons is simply an icon to indicate what the button is going to do. This is great for use on simple well known actions that the user will do a lot, like adding a new maintenance log, etc. This style too come with bot the filled and the outline variation.

The last one would be a simple combination of both, where the icons will be paired with the text to keep the personality of the app using the icons but still clarify what the buttons is going to achieve mostly for the actions that the user won't be doing too much of, for example, editing a car information.

#### Fonts

We used the font Inter for readability and the customizability of the font itself, stretching from boldness to italics and underlines, this will fit the application of being simplistic but still being accessible for the user.

#### Iconography

For the Icons, we decided to use the Material Design icons by Google as it is an established icon library that ensured a meaningful graphic for what the icon is trying to imply. They too come with different variations, from Outlined, Filled, Rounded, and Two-Toned, and by choosing Material Design we can ensure that our icons will be consistent throughout the different menus.
